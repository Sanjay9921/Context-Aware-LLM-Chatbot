# Context Aware LLM Chatbot

# 1. Project Overview
An interactive chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs and ask natural language questions based on their contents. The chatbot uses a language model API and intelligent preprocessing to provide context-aware answers.

Deployable on Streamlit Cloud, this tool is perfect for students, researchers, and professionals who want a lightweight document Q&A system.

## 5.2 Deployment

> [!TIP]
> Deploying the app on Streamlit cloud is faster and cleaner than local as you do not have to install anything on your local system

### 5.2.1 Local
* Create a `.env` file in the root directory
* Add the following API:
```bash
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
* Run the streamlit app using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
* The application will open in: `http://localhost:8501/`

### 5.2.2 Streamlit Cloud
* Create a new Github repository
* Push the code to the new repository and go to [StreamLit](https://share.streamlit.io/)
* Select the option to deploy via your Github app
* Add your secret API key in the `Secrets` section before deploying in the following `TOML` format:
`TOGETHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"`
